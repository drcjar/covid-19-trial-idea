 1. I had an idea that an RCT of n-acetylcysteine for admitted covid-19
confirmed cases with an outcome of ITU or not might be valuable because:

- there might be a sars-cov2 mucin like domain involved in immunoevasion[1]

- it might be possible to disrupt sars-cov2 mucin like domain with NAC to the benefit of the host

- there's been some evidence NAC might be helpful in other viral infections; I found a few influenza studies in rodents and one in humans[2] and one case report of NAC for H1N1[3]

- I saw a chinese group are looking at giving intubated covid-19 patients NAC[4]

I do not know enough to know if the idea is any good or what the steps would be / if it's realistic to get an RCT set up quickly. What do you think?

2. I can see 522 covid-19 trials registered on WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform[5] but none in the UK. I will be working clinically during the pandemic at Imperial (I'm currently ST7 resp and gen med at CXH). I strongly feel we should be doing research on covid-19 during the
pandemic and would be v happy to support any approved research I can during this
period. Can I help?

Thanks, Carl
